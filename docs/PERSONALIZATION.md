> How to add custom configuration without messing the local repository

## For the shell itself

You can add anything you want (secret stuff, for example), to the `~/.localrc` file.

## For git

You can just change the default `~/.gitconfig` file, since it includes the dotfiles managed one.

## For psql

You can edit the `~/.psqlrc.local` file.
